#  Stock Trade Simulator
### [**How to invest for dummies?**](https://github.com/FreddyDoesIT/How-to-Invest-for-Dummies-Stock-Trade-Simulator)

Come on and check out this awesome application which can provide you with the most up-to-date stock data that **you** can have to practice your investment sense.

## Project Objective
* The purpose of this application is to help users who are new to investing to learn about how money could grow, in the style of "virtual gambling". Similar to virtual gambling, my application will not use real money and investment. Instead it will allow the user to create investment portfolios, try out buying and selling of stocks, and various investment strategies to see how they can grow (or shrink) their money with time.

* For the technology part, this project is basically designed under the Model-View-Controller architecture, which has been implemented by coding in Java 8 and the GUI to deliver the user interface. Conducted JUnit tests to make sure the functionality.
